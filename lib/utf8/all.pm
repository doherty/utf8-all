# ABSTRACT: turn on Unicode - all of it
# VERSION

=encoding utf8
=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use utf8::all; # Turn on UTF-8. All of it.

    open my $in, '<', 'contains-utf8';  # UTF-8 already turned on here
    print length 'føø bār';             # 7 UTF-8 characters
    my $utf8_arg = shift @ARGV;         # @ARGV is UTF-8 too!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<utf8> allows you to write your Perl encoded in UTF-8. That means UTF-8
strings, variable names, and regular expressions. C<utf8::all> goes further, and
makes C<@ARGV> encoded in UTF-8, and filehandles are opened with UTF-8 encoding
turned on by default (including STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR), and charnames are
imported so C<\N{...}> sequences can be used to compile Unicode characters based
on names. If you I<don't> want UTF-8 for a particular filehandle, you'll have to
set C<binmode $filehandle>.

The pragma is lexically-scoped, so you can do the following if you had some
reason to:

    {
        use utf8::all;
        open my $out, '>', 'outfile';
        my $utf8_str = 'føø bār';
        print length $utf8_str, "\n"; # 7
        print $out $utf8_str;         # out as utf8
    }
    open my $in, '<', 'outfile';      # in as raw
    my $text = do { local $/; <$in>};
    print length $text, "\n";         # 10, not 7!

=head1 INTERACTION WITH AUTODIE

If you use L<autodie>, which is a great idea, you need to use at least version
B<2.12>, released on L<June 26, 2012|https://metacpan.org/source/PJF/autodie-2.12/Changes#L3>.
Otherwise, autodie obliterates the IO layers set by the L<open> pragma. See
L<RT #54777|https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=54777> and
L<GH #7|https://github.com/doherty/utf8-all/issues/7>.
